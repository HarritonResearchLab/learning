## NYC Trees
In this lesson you'll explore data visualization, using data from the 1995 New York City Tree census. 

The data file ```nyc_1995_trees.csv``` is a random sample of the original census results file and includes approximately 5000 entries (this corresponds to about 1% of the original census data). 

Here are some things you can explore with this data: 
* Python modules: pandas (for interacting with the .csv data and using dataframes), numpy (handy array operations), and matplotlib (for plotting).
* Plots: a bar graph of the number of species per borough, the number of trees per borough, and if you're up for a challenge, plotting the coordinates of the trees over a map of New York City. 
* Statistics: is the mean number of trees in each borough significantly different to the mean number of trees in the other boroughs? Is the species distribution significantly different between the boroughs? 
* Jupyter Notebooks: Try exploring this in a Jupyter notebook (there's a nice vscode extension for them). When you're done add it in solutions. 

Tips: 
* If relative paths are troublesome, accessing the raw .csv data file is handy (click the "raw" option on GitHub and use that link as the data path). 
* Use the documentation for each module!

Happy coding!
