    "# Period Detective Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "* Once you download and extract the .zip file ```light_curves.zip```, you will find a file inside it called ```key.csv``` which importantly contains a column of stellar identifiers for the 323 stars that have data in the ```light_curves/light_curves``` directory you will be working with in this exercise. \n",
    "* Your goal is to iterate through each of the object's ```_r.csv``` files (e.g. the file for the star ```2MASS_J20470481+4349114``` would be ```2MASS_J20470481+4349114_r.csv```), run the Lomb-Scargle periodogram on that light curve, return a list of stars whose lightcurves are periodic (for now we will assume stars whose peak power is more than 0.5 to have significant periods), and then make phase-folded light curve plots for those stars, as well as making a histogram displaying the distribution of periods among those stars with significant periods. \n",
    "* As a first step, I talk a glance through this Astropy documentation example which explores the Lomb-Scargle Algorithm with simulated data: [link](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/timeseries/lombscargle.html). \n",
    "* Once you're done, please make a new folder in the ```./solutions``` directory of this project and put your code and plots in it so we can practice using GitHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Hints\n",
    "* Run the Lomb-Scargle Algorithm like this (after extracting the ```mjd``` and ```mag``` arrays from the .csv file and importing ```LombScargle``` with ```from astropy.timeseries import LombScargle```): \n",
    "```python\n",
    "ls = LombScargle(mjd, mag)\n",
    "frequencies, powers = ls.autopower(minimum_frequency=0.05, maximum_frequency=0.5)\n",
    "periods = 1/frequencies\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Setting ```minimum_frequency=0.05``` and ```maximum_frequency=0.5``` will restrict your search space between periods of two and fifty days (as period = 1/frequency, the maximum frequency $0.5$ is the shortest period $\\frac{1}{0.5}=2$). \n",
    "* You want to focus on the period with the highest power for each light curve, and (as mentioned), for the purposes of this excercise only consider a period with power $>0.5$ to be significant. \n",
    "* Note that since lower values are brighter in the magnitude system, you'll want to invert the y-axis of your light curve plot. \n",
    "* You can save plots in matplotlib with ```plt.savefig()```\n",
    "\n",

    "* Phase-folded light curve:  \n",
    "![]()\n",
    "\n",
    "* Periods distribution histogram:  \n",
