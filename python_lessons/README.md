# Grey Kangaroo
In this lesson you'll explore linear regression with a data set from the down under. 

The data file ```kangaroos.csv``` is adopted from WE Poole and SM Carpenter Australian Journal of Zoology, Vol. 28, p607-613 and contains nasal length and width measurements (both in mm) for 46 Grey Kangaroos from Kangaroo Island, South Australia.

Here are some things you can explore with the data: 
* Is there a relationship between nasal lengths and nasal widths? Explore this by plotting them against eachother. Is it linear or something else? 
* If you do observe a linear relationship, explore linear regression. 

Tips
* ```scipy.stats.linregress``` is very handy for linear regressions. 

Happy coding!
