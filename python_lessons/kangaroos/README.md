# Grey Kangaroo
In this lesson you'll explore linear regression with a data set from the down under. 

The data file ```kangaroos.csv``` is adopted from WE Poole and SM Carpenter Australian Journal of Zoology, Vol. 28, p607-613 and contains nasal length and width measurements (both in mm) for 45 Grey Kangaroos from Kangaroo Island, South Australia.

Here are some things you can explore with the data: 
* Is there a relationship between nasal lengths and nasal widths? Explore this by plotting them against eachother. Is it linear or something else? 
* If you do observe a linear relationship, explore linear regression. How well does the best fit line describe the data? What does the best fit line look like overplotted on the data? What is the difference between r and r^2?

Tips
* ```scipy.stats.linregress``` is very handy for linear regressions. 

Happy coding!
